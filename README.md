# Project Description: 
# Why is it important or interesting to you?
  - As college students, we find the task manager project important because we find it difficult to mange our time wisely. With the surge of online classes, many classes use different websites to submit assignments, which makes it difficult to manage all the assignments. With the task manager, we can use a single platform to keep track of all of these assignments and also set the priority of these assignments to create an effective task list. Additionally, we can include our personal and work tasks too to make the most out of the application.
# What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?
  - We plan on using C++, git, Vim, C++ gui libraries, and PuTTY. 
# What will be the input/output of your project?
  -Our input will consist of events, courses, times, and deadlines entered by the user.
Our output will be a neatly arranged schedule displaying all events and courses for the week in chronological order
